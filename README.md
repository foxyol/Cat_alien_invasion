# (Cat) Alien Invasion
Alien invasion is a clone of popular arcade game with same name.
I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book, ver.3. 
The reason was to try myself in python and make an arcade not with ships
and aliens, but with Pusheen cat and donuts. Below you can find some notes
in brackets (like this one) 

##  Introduction
> In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship (cat) that appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship(cat)
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets(try to catch donuts) using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens(lots of donuts) fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
